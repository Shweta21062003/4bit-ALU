This project implements a 4-bit ALU in Verilog HDL capable of performing arithmetic and logic operations like addition, subtraction, AND, OR, and XOR based on a control input. A testbench verifies its functionality using ModelSim, ensuring correct outputs through waveform-level simulation of various input combinations.
